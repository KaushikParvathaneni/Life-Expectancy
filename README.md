# Life-Expectancy

My project aims to know the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy, using data from the Gapminder dataset which includes 142 countries over the period from 1952 to 2007. The primary research question is whether the increase in life expectancy since World War II can be largely explained by increases in GDP per capita. To address this, we will explore several specific questions, such as the variation of life expectancy with GDP per capita in 2007 across different continents, the changes in average life expectancy over time by continent, and the evolution of the relationship between GDP and life expectancy over time. This analysis will involve creating and interpreting various models to identify trends and patterns, ensuring the results are understandable and actionable for the researcher.
